The game is a visual dating simulator. Operating the game is mainly through mouseclicking. The dialogue will continue automatically, so clicking is not necessary. However when it is a scene where you must make a choice of what to say or do, you must click on one of the choices provided. These choices will be framed by a rectangle, click anywhere within their respective rectangles, and you will follow that path. The choices that you make will contribute to the total number of love points that you accumulate, which will affect which ending of the story you will receive. PLease wait for choices to load, and please do not click rapidly; just have patience when playing. Early in the game, there is a math minigame that utilizes stacks. You are given a series of questions in which you must choose the correct answer to pass. To choose an answer, you use the keys "a", "b", or "c" to indicate what answer you have chosen. After choosing the answer, you will then be prompted to press the right arrow key to move onto the next question. This minigame will also contribute to the total number of lovepoints. The game utilizes a tree for the different paths you can take based on your choices. The tree is made up of nodes of LinkedLists which are made up LNodes of Strings that represent the dialogue. The math minigame utilizes stacks and is similar to StackCalc which was done for an assignment.
